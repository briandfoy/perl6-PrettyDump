## Level 1 - Inquiry

* create an issue to tell me what you're thinking about. We'll go from there.
* if you want a particular feature, ensure it fits in the goals of this module.
* if I don't get back to you within a week, bug me in email *brian.d.foy@gmail.com*. Sometimes the GitHub notifications don't reach me.

## Level 2 - Bug report

* create a short, minimal program that demonstrates the problem, if you can
* you don't have to know why it happens, just show me that it does happen
* put that program in an issue

## Level 3 - Pull request

* you might start with an issue before you do a lot of work
* maybe you want to work on an existing issue
* when you create a pull request, check that you do three things that help me incorporate your changes:
	* your fix or change
	* update the docs
	* create a test
* check that the tests pass locally (your PR will trigger the GitHub Actions too).
* if I have to handle lots of that, it goes toward the bottom of my to-do list
* if you can't do all that, no big whoop, but I might not be able to immediately set aside the time to follow up

## Level 4 - Fork

* if you want something much different than what this module does, use my code as a basis. Change it however you like according to the very liberal license.
